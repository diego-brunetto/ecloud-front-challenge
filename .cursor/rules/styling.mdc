# Styling & Responsive Design

## Mobile-First Approach
- Start with mobile (320px+) and scale up
- Target breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 320px - 768px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1024px  
  - Desktop: 1024px+

## Chakra UI Standards
- Use Chakra's responsive props: `{ base: "value", md: "value" }`
- Minimize custom CSS, prefer Chakra utilities
- Use Chakra's spacing system (4px grid)
- Follow Chakra's color token system

## Challenge-Specific Requirements
### Main Story Features
- Nav with dropdown hover on "Experimenta"
- Hero section (static initially)
- Reservation drawer on "Reservar" click
- Hotel list with hover effects (blur + description expansion)
- Hotel slider with Swiper.js

### Sidequest Enhancements
- Custom hover states with smooth transitions
- Navigation scroll behavior (hide/show)
- Hero slider with auto-play and progress bars
- Custom cursor (desktop only)
- Smooth microinteractions

## Performance Targets
- Lighthouse Score: >90 (Performance, SEO, Accessibility)
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s
- Zero console errors in production
